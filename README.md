# React-Redux Farm Game

- This game allows users to drag farm-related items on a grid, and encourages the user to think about maximizing the game points. Points can be gained when the right elements are on the screen and when the user takes good care of those elements. For instance, a user can choose to fill part of the grid with crops. Those crops need to be watered and further taken care of. If these tasks are performed, the user gains points.

- When a user is required to take action, a popup will show on the screen to warn the user.
- There is a time element to this game. The user can speed up the speed up to 3x.
- The game finishes after 10 years have passed. You cannot 'lose' the game.


### Game 2.0

- Users can log in to their account.
- Scores will be scored using a backend.
- The game will take seasons into consideration.
- More items can be dragged onto the screen.
- More attention will be paid to the visual presentation of the game.


### The MVP of this project will at least contain the following components and containers:

-  App
-  SidePanel
  - Category
    - DraggableElement
-  Grid
  - Box


  ```
  git clone git@github.com:sanlouise/react-redux-game.git

  cd react-redux-game

  yarn

  yarn start
  ```

  Your app will now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
